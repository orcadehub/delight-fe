      <p>
        Atreyapuram, a charming village in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India, is famous for its traditional sweet delicacy called “Putharekulu.” This wafer-thin sweet, often known as the “Paper Sweet” due to its delicate, paper-like texture, has a unique history deeply connected to the region’s cultural and culinary traditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Origin of Putharekulu</h2>
      <p>
        The word “Putharekulu” comes from two Telugu words: “Putha,” which means coating or cover, and “Reku,” which means sheet or layer. This sweet is made by layering thin rice starch sheets that resemble paper and filling them with a mixture of sugar, jaggery, and ghee. Sometimes, dry fruits are added for extra flavor. It is believed that the sweet originated several centuries ago in Atreyapuram when locals discovered that rice flour, when heated and spread over a hot pan, could be made into delicate sheets that could hold sweet fillings.

          <strong>Rice Starch Sheets:</strong> A special kind of rice batter is spread thinly on an inverted clay pot that is heated over a fire. As the batter touches the pot, it forms a thin, translucent sheet.

        <li>
          <strong>Filling:</strong> Once the rice sheet is dried, it is carefully peeled off and layered with a mixture of ghee, powdered sugar or jaggery, and dry fruits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rolling:</strong> The sheets are then folded and rolled into cylindrical shapes to create the final sweet.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The entire process is labor-intensive, and artisans in Atreyapuram are known for mastering this delicate art.
